It doesn’t try to be a Swiss Army knife with any number of useless attachments that will never see action. Instead, it&#39;s more like the humble screwdriver you keep in the kitchen drawer because it always does exactly what you need. You write some Markdown, tweak a few Svelte files, and suddenly you’re staring at a real website. It&#39;s fast, and it&#39;s reliable.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There are plenty of static site generators out there, but Statue is designed to feel clearer. With very little guesswork, you know where the files live and what each one does. When something inevitably breaks, you know exactly what file needs correcting. You spend less time fiddling and more time actually making the website you envisioned. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you want a technical deep dive, we’ve included that within our documentation. This post is about what it feels like to actually build something with Statue.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2>Your First Steps\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Starting a Statue project is as simple as copying this command into your terminal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode>yes | npx sv create . --template minimal --types ts --no-add-ons --install npm &amp;&amp; npm install statue-ssg &amp;&amp; npx statue init &amp;&amp; npm install &amp;&amp; npm run dev\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>Just like that, a new Statue project is written to your directory, and a local site appears in your browser. Obviously, you&#39;ll need to make some updates to your project unless you, for whatever reason, want to make a Statue SSG website. If that is the case, thanks for the free advertising.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Looking at your project directory, you will not find files named things like “config-helper-legacy-backup” that you’re terrified to delete or edit. Everything is arranged with a clear logic that makes you feel like maybe, making your new website won&#39;t be such a headache.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2>Customizing Your Site\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Let&#39;s say I want to customize my new site to represent the most exciting and unique product I can possibly think of, IT consulting services. The current site is nice, but right now it has all the personality of a default static site generator landing page. We can change that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Open \u003Ccode>src/routes/+page.svelte\u003C/code> and get creative. With Statue&#39;s built in component library, we can start dropping in a services section, a few testimonials, and even a button pointing to \u003Ccode>/case-studies\u003C/code> that will link to a new case studies section.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hop into the \u003Ccode>content/\u003C/code> folder and create a new directory called \u003Ccode>case-studies\u003C/code>. Statue immediately understands what you’re doing, and your aforementioned button and header get a working link to the new section without you having to think about it. Just add your first case study as a Markdown file to the \u003Ccode>content/case-studies/\u003C/code> directory, and suddenly, your site starts to feel real.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2>Making the Whole Site Feel Cohesive\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Once you’ve added your content, you might notice your theme looks a bit mismatched. The landing page is on one wavelength, the other pages are on another, and the color palette has no cohesion. DO NOT PANIC.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You can shape the theme in \u003Ccode>src/routes/[...slug]/+page.svelte\u003C/code> and \u003Ccode>src/routes/[directory]/+page.svelte\u003C/code> until everything matches. A quick update to \u003Ccode>src/routes/about/+page.svelte\u003C/code> pulls the about page into the same aesthetic.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For the final touch, head into \u003Ccode>src/lib/index.css\u003C/code> and swap in one of Statue’s default themes. Since we&#39;re already on a blue kick, we&#39;ll just use the \u003Ccode>statue-ssg/themes/blue.css\u003C/code> theme.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2>Deploying to Cloudflare Pages\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>When your site looks good and you’re ready to send it out into the world, deployment is as easy as building the initial project.

Statue has those, but its real magic is how it feels to use. It is clear and frictionless, and you get to build the site you want no matter your level of expertise.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Statue is not just a tool for making websites. We made it to be a tool that makes the process enjoyable, which might be the most underrated feature in all of web development.\u003C/p>\n",{"title":30,"description":31,"date":32,"author":33,"category":34,"order":27},"Static Sites, Stupid Simple","Statue is any webdev's best friend",["Date","2025-11-21T00:00:00.000Z"],"Brant Feick","statue",{"slug":36,"path":37,"url":38,"directory":3,"mainDirectory":3,"depth":27,"content":39,"metadata":40},"statue-component-library","blog/statue-component-library.md","/blog/statue-component-library","\n\u003Cp>We’re excited to introduce the \u003Ca href=\"https://statue.dev/components/\">Statue Component Library\u003C/a>, our growing collection of completely free, production-ready Svelte components you can add to your project with zero hassle.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you’ve ever browsed a component gallery only to find yourself buried in configuration steps and missing dependencies, you’re going to love this. Since each component is built with Statue in mind, they behave exactly as you would expect within your Statue site. Our goal is to provide beautiful components without complex setup. What you see is literally what you get.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2>Why We Built It\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>While experimenting with other UI libraries on Statue sites, we kept running into the same exhausting pattern: a component would look perfect in the demo, then require an hour of configuration wrestling just to match what we&#39;d seen in the gallery. We&#39;d have to import this CSS file, add these props, install these peer dependencies, override these default styles—by the time we got it working. We&#39;d spent more time fighting the component than actually building.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That frustration pushed us to create something more dependable. We wanted components that leaned into Statue&#39;s strengths: simplicity and clarity with no bait-and-switch between demo and reality. No configuration archaeology to figure out why your button doesn&#39;t look like their button. Just components that work exactly as shown, immediately.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2>What’s Inside\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The Statue Component Library already includes a selection of frequently needed UI pieces, and we&#39;re excited to release new components as Statue grows and develops.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What&#39;s inside:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Core interactive elements such as buttons, forms, and inputs\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Navigation pieces that slot naturally into any layout\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Layout helpers for structuring pages without heavy styling\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Content blocks including cards, lists, and media elements\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Site accents like announcement banners and simple footers\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Every component has been designed to be clean, accessible, and ready to use without a pile of configuration. Of course, you still can still customize any component to your heart&#39;s content, but you don’t have to.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2>What You See Is What You Get\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>This idea drives the entire library, as every component appears in the gallery exactly as it will appear in your project without hidden style packages or props you have to decode. All you need to do is copy it, drop it into a file, and keep moving.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Each component displayed in Statue&#39;s library is actually rendered within Statue.dev, meaning you can always be assured that any component listed has been tested on a live, production Statue site. Simply import any component directly from statue-ssg. For example:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode>&lt;script lang=&quot;ts&quot;&gt;\nimport {BuiltBy} from &#39;statue-ssg&#39;;\n// your typescript\n&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;!-- your svelte --&gt;\n&lt;BuiltBy builtInIcon={&quot;/favicon.png&quot;} /&gt;\n&lt;!-- the rest of your svelte --&gt;\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>Alternatively, install Statue with \u003Ccode>npm install statue-ssg\u003C/code>, and every component in our library becomes available to your project immediately. This works in any Svelte project, not just sites built with Statue. Whether you&#39;re using SvelteKit, Vite, or any other Svelte setup, the components just work.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Our focus is on making Statue&#39;s component library a true plug-and-play experience. Just import it and keep building.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2>Contributing Your Own Components\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The Statue Component Library thrives on community contributions, and we genuinely want your components. If you&#39;ve built something useful for your own Statue site, there&#39;s a good chance others would benefit from it too.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Contributing is simple. Since Statue components are just standard Svelte files with minimal dependencies, you&#39;re likely already 90% of the way there if you&#39;ve created something for your own project. Write a single component, make sure it works in your Statue site, and submit it. That&#39;s it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We actively review and merge community contributions. Our bar for inclusion is straightforward: does it work well in a Statue site, is the code reasonably clean, and would others find it useful? If the answer is yes, we want it in the library.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Whether it&#39;s a date picker you built last week, a custom card layout that solved a specific problem, or a navigation pattern you&#39;re particularly proud of—submit it. We&#39;ll work with you to get it merged. The library grows stronger with each contribution, and we&#39;re committed to making the process as friction-free as possible.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Check out our \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/accretional/statue?tab=contributing-ov-file\">contribution guidelines\u003C/a> to get started, or open an issue to discuss an idea before you build it.
